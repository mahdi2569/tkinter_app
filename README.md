# Tkinter GUI Project

This is my first real Python application using Tkinter.  
I'm currently learning GUI development and practicing how to build interactive desktop apps.

## Features
- Simple form with name, last name, and age inputs  
- Submit and exit buttons  
- Error handling with message boxes  
- Organized layout using LabelFrames

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.10+ recommended)
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahdi2569/tkinter_app.git
